# Vega Cards

An experimental prototype front-end for interactively rendering visualisations in Vega/Vega-Lite. A simple composition of [reframe](https://github.com/day8/re-frame), [reagent](http://reagent-project.github.io) and [hanami](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami) with [material-ui](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami) styling. Managed with [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs).

# Installation

Run using `npx shadow-cljs watch app` and navigate to `localhost:8020`.
